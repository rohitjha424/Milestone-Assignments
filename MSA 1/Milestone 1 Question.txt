An online Customer Information system wants to leverage the customer Information. 
Each customer has attributes like id, name, puchaseAmount. 
Create an Java based application to achieve the following Information.


Create an switch case program where user needs to enter number of customer data. If user enters 10 
then system should create 10 customer records.

Once system created 10 customer records with id, name and puchaseAmount then following are use cases:



Case1: Display all 10 customer records based on their purchaseAmount in descending order. 
If two customer have same purchaseAmount then display based on their name in ascending order.


Case2: Update a particular Customer's purchase amount by passing the id and updated value as parameter. 
Example: If you want to update customer records whose id is 5 and purchase amount 100. Then from the ArrayList 
it will first search the customer whose id is 5 and then It will just add 100 rupees on top of the existing purchaseAmount. 
Let's say if existing purchaseAmount is 500 for Customer id 5 then it will update to 500+100. 
After Successfully update it will display the new updated data in console.



Case3: write an Custom or user defined exception for Case2. 
Example: If the user provides an id of the customer which is not present in the ArrayList then system will 
throw an exception "No such id is present in the Record".


Case4: Exit (once user enter3 it will exist from the application).
